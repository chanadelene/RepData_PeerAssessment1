## Loading and preprocessing the data

1. Load the data (i.e. read.csv())

```{r}
unzip('activity.zip')
accel <- read.csv('activity.csv', header=TRUE, sep = ',')
str(accel)
for(i in 1:length(accel) ) {
  str(accel[i])
  }
```

We observe that the date variable is of the type Factor, we therefore recode it as a date variable.

```{r}
accel$date <- as.Date( accel$date, format = '%Y-%m-%d' )
str(accel$date)
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?



## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
